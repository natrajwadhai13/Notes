### 🔁 Que 1) What is the difference between Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment? Can you explain with an example from your past project?
### ✅ **Answer**
Continuous Integration (CI) is the process where developers frequently merge code changes into the main branch. This triggers automated builds and tests to ensure nothing is broken.

Continuous Delivery (CD) extends CI by making sure that the code is always in a deployable state. After passing tests, it is pushed to staging or pre-prod automatically, but manual approval is required for production.

Continuous Deployment goes a step further — even the production deployment is automated, with no manual approval.

In my current company, we use GitLab CI/CD pipelines. Developers push code to feature branches, and a pipeline is triggered automatically for build, test, and deploy. We follow a multi-stage environment strategy:

Code is deployed to Test1, then Test2 using Ansible.

Once verified, we promote it to Production.

This ensures smooth CI/CD flow and stable releases.

### 🔁 Que 2) Can you explain how you have written or used a GitLab CI/CD pipeline file (.gitlab-ci.yml)? Mention any important stages, variables, or jobs used.
### ✅ **Answer**
Yes, I’ve worked on writing and maintaining .gitlab-ci.yml files to automate build, test, and deployment workflows.

Here's a high-level structure of what we use:

```yaml

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  APP_NAME: my-node-app
  DEPLOY_ENV: staging

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building $APP_NAME"
    - npm install
    - npm run build

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm test

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  only:
    - master
  script:
    - ansible-playbook deploy.yml -i inventory/$DEPLOY_ENV

```

### 🔁 Que-3 Can you explain how Ansible is used in your pipeline for deployment?

What kind of playbooks did you write or use?

What was being deployed — Docker containers, packages, Node apps, etc.?

How was inventory handled?

### ✅ **Answer**
How We Use Ansible for Deployment

In my company, I manage deployment automation for more than **18+ applications** using **Ansible**.

We follow a clear structure:

 1. **Inventory File:**
We maintain a dynamic or static inventory file where we define:

* Application name as groups (e.g., `[webapp1]`, `[dbapp1]`)
* Server IPs or hostnames
* Role tags like `web`, `app`, or `db`

>    **Example:**
>
>    ```ini
>    [web]
>    192.168.10.5 ansible_user=ubuntu
>
>    [db]
>    192.168.10.6 ansible_user=ubuntu
>    ```
>
> 2. **Playbooks:**
>    For each application, we create separate playbooks that define tasks like:
>
>    * Pulling code from Git repo
>    * Installing dependencies
>    * Managing Docker containers (if used)
>    * Copying environment variables
>    * Restarting services (like `nginx`, `pm2`, `node`, etc.)
>
>    **Example snippet:**
>
>    ```yaml
>    - name: Deploy web app
>      hosts: web
>      tasks:
>        - name: Clone repo
>          git:
>            repo: 'https://gitlab.com/myorg/myapp.git'
>            dest: /var/www/myapp
>        - name: Install npm packages
>          command: npm install
>          args:
>            chdir: /var/www/myapp
>    ```
>
> 3. **Integration with GitLab CI/CD:**
>
>    * The `deploy` stage of the pipeline runs this playbook using:
>
>      ```bash
>      ansible-playbook -i inventory/staging.ini deploy.yml
>      ```
>    * We pass environment variables from GitLab to Ansible using `extra_vars`.

### 💡 Extra Points to Mention (if interviewer goes deeper)

* Handled **idempotency** with Ansible modules (`copy`, `service`, `template`)
* Used **Ansible Vault** to store secrets
* Organized roles using `ansible-galaxy init`
* Used dynamic inventories for AWS (optional if applicable)
